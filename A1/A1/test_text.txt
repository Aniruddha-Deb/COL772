"I loved everything about this dress!  It was super comfortable and the reviews were right that it runs about a size down I am always a 6 and I wore the 8.  The compliments that I got on this dress were nothing short of amazing and I have not one bad thing to say!  I am 5'9 so the length was great for me as well, I highly recommend this rental!"
"I wore this with a long sleeved, collared, black silk shirt. The layers played nicely together, and worked well with jeans during the day, black leather leggings in the evening."
"Wore size 6 since reviews said it ran a tad small. Wish i ordered the size 4, as the size 6 was a bit loose in the hips and waist. Overall very comfortable and looks great with t-strap heels. "
"I wore this for my father's retirement party with some important colleagues and politicians and felt like it was a great choice.  Beautiful dress.  The lace in this dress doesn't stretch or give at all, so it feels a bit restrictive in the shoulders.  Given the arm coverage, I only wish it were an inch or so longer in the hem since I'm on the tall side."
"I was told to get a white dress for my Bachelorette weekend in Palm Springs. Since I knew I didn't want to purchase a new white fancy dress, my MOH suggested RTR. It was my 1st time using this service & I absolutely loved it! I got compliments all night long from women, straight & gay men! I ordered the 4 and the 6 was my backup. The 4 fit like a glove, but I couldn't raise my arms all the way up (definitely try out some dance moves if you're planning to be dancing) - perhaps my shoulders may be a bit broader. The 6 fit fine, didn't look loose, and turned out for the better since we ate dinner before the dancing. My only minor complaint is that the dress doesn't allow for much airflow beyond the bottom of the dress. I tend to sweat when I dance in general and in 113 degree heat (remember this was in July in Palm Springs), it was getting hot! Overall, beautiful dress and I loved how I looked in all of the pictures."
"I rented this gown for a military ball, and was happy with the result!  If you have an apple body type like I do, this gown may not be the most flattering fit, but with some Spanx and a good bra, you can make it work!  Overall, I found the dress to run small in the waist, but true to size, if not a little large, in the bust.  Like other reviewers have mentioned, this dress runs long, but I wore 3"" heels and was able to walk around with no problems.  If you are going to dance at all, be prepared to pick up the skirt so your heels won't catch on the hem.  I received compliments all night long, and most importantly, my husband loved the overall look!  I will definitely ""Rent the Runway"" again :)"
"Normally I'm a size 4-6 and I decided to wear the 4. The 6 was about 2 inches longer and I'm only 5'1""; felt more loose in the back too. Received so many compliments on this dress! It was perfect. "
True the size 4R  - Military Ball FB flooded with compliments!
There was a lot of material at the top of this skirt which made it look more bulky than I wanted and made me feel much larger in the thinnest part of my body. I did not end up wearing it. I would plan to wear with a very slim fitted top. 
"I was a wedding guest for a September wedding. The length was just perfect, not to long and not to short. My most favorite part of the dress was the open back! I paired the dress with nude Jessica Simpson heels (all together it looked great) All I can say is that I loved this dress."
"I wore this for a party in NYC
It fits PERFECT for my size and frame it was not too short,tight, it was gorgeous!
I did size up to the 8R bc of my bust I would recommend if you are larger busted you will be happier with one size up so you don't feel smushed in it 
This dress looks even better in person than in the photos "
The dress fit well except for the fact it was wayyyyyyy too short. I couldn't raise my arms up without the dress coming completely up.
"This dress is an absolute show stopper.  I wish it would have fit, but it was too small in the bust.  Fit beautifully everywhere else but I couldn't zip it :(.  I am 5'2"" and the 6R was a great length for me with 3"" heels.  I really wish this would have fit because it is gorgeous!"
"This dress runs very small! If your arms aren't super bony, you have a wide back,
and/or you have a B or C cup, this will be tight. I'm usually a 4 or 6 and I had to get
8. The 4 and 6 fit fine in the body but the arms were so tight, I had to go up a size. 
As previous reviews state, there is no stretch in that dress. With that said, I loved it and
everyone kept asking where I bought it.

I'm 5'4, 140lbs, 36C
  Size up!"
